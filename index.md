## About

<img align='right' height='200' width='300' src="./assets/prasad.jpg"/>

I am a Computational Physicist working in [Whitford Research Group](https://web.northeastern.edu/whitford/) at Northeastern University. I implement statistical physics tools to identify the physical principles that guide biomolecular dynamics. I worked on large datasets of simulated MD data to dissect features relevant to nano-scale experiments on the same molecules. I collaborated with the [Wanunu lab](http://www.northeastern.edu/wanunu/) to develop a [computational approach](https://github.com/prasadbandarkar/gromacs) connecting the flexibilty of these molecules and the nano-pore experiments.
